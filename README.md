# weatherPro



## Usage
Using Openweather API (about Weather API).

Real-time Weather ViewTower Project -> Server(Node.js) + HTML + CSS + Javascript + MySQL + Raspberry PI 2 Model B + Devices(RGB LED, Motors, DHT11 Sensor, Speaker, etc...)

The project should be run in the raspberry pi.

Make your registration (Openweather API, Google Cloud Message(GCM - Server Key) )

and, Get the API key only for you.

Modify your key in my code.

plus, Modify Your Project name + etc.. in my code.

In my project, The Server must be running first.

You should use the Mysql, And it should be pre-connected to the Device Raspberry.(about DHT11 Sensor, LED, Motors, Speaker, other Devices...)

Good luck!
