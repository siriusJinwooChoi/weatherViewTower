Make your registration (Openweather API, Google Cloud Message(GCM - Server Key) )

and, Get the API key only for you.

Modify your key in my code.

plus, Modify Your Project name + etc.. in my code.

In my project, The Server must be running first.

You should install the Mysql in Raspberry PI, And it should be pre-connected to the Device Raspberry.(about DHT11 Sensor, LED, Motors, Speaker, other Devices...)
